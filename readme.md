# Smartbingo-solver
A brute force solver for the game [Smart Bingo](https://github.com/26F-Studio/smartbingo).

The solver will try *every single* possible configuration (it will not intellegently ignore obviously wrong answers) and give you a solution with the fewest ticks and a solution with the most ticks.
